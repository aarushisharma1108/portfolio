<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Aarushi Sharma, a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for crafting innovative web solutions. My journey in the tech world has been driven by a love for problem-solving and a curiosity for how things work. With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I strive to create seamless, user-friendly applications that enhance the user experience. I believe that technology should be accessible and intuitive, and I aim to bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics in my work.
    My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries, enabling me to build responsive and interactive websites. On the back end, I work with Node.js, Express and MongoDB to develop robust server-side applications that efficiently handle data and user requests.
    Beyond coding, I value the importance of collaboration and communication. I enjoy working in teams where ideas flow freely, and creativity thrives. Whether it’s brainstorming solutions or discussing design concepts, I believe that diverse perspectives lead to the best outcomes.  
   Thank you for visiting my portfolio. </p>
